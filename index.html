<h2>About Tigers</h2>
<p>The tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) is one of many animals that the world knows what it is and even what it can do, also connected with strength and its appearance in overall nature. The most respected in wildlife, inspiring people with its beauty and acts, but also significant in faiths and folktales of many civilizations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tigers are on the verge of extinction. A long time ago, Asia was the capital for tiger hood, where 100,000 tigers lived and roamed around the Asian lands. Today, approximately 5,600 live, trying to keep their population and history alive for many more years to come, many living in trapped zoos or still roaming around Asia and maybe even other places across the world. The largest tiger population can now be found in India, home to half of all remaining wild tigers. Much of this decline has occurred in the past decade.</p>
