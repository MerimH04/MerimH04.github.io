    <h3>About Tigers</h3>
    <p>The tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) is one of many animals that the world knows what it is and even what it can do, also connected with strength and its appearance in overall nature. The most respected in wildlife, inspiring people with its beauty and acts, but also significant in faiths and folktales of many civilizations.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, tigers are on the verge of extinction. A long time ago, Asia was the capital for tiger hood, where 100,000 tigers lived and roamed around the Asian lands. Today, approximately 5,600 live, trying to keep their population and history alive for many more years to come, many living in trapped zoos or still roaming around Asia and maybe even other places across the world. The largest tiger population can now be found in India, home to half of all remaining wild tigers. Much of this decline has occurred in the past decade.</p>

    <h4>Tiger Population/locations</h4>
    <p>The majority of the tiger population is found in India, which is home to approximately half of all remaining wild tigers. Tigers also roam parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar, as well as regions of Russia and China. Their habitats range from tropical forests and mangroves to grasslands and snowy landscapes, where they rely on dense vegetation and prey-rich environments to survive. Despite once having a much broader distribution across Asia, tigers are now confined to fragmented pockets due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, making their protection in these remaining areas crucial for their survival.</p>
    <h5> Fun Facts About Tigers</h5>
    <p>1. Just like human fingerprints, each tiger's stripes are unique. No two tigers have the same pattern, making each one easily identifiable. Their stripes help camouflage them in their natural habitats, allowing them to blend into the dense vegetation.</p>
    <p>2. Tigers are excellent swimmers and are known to enjoy water. They can swim across rivers and lakes, sometimes covering great distances in search of food. Unlike many other big cats, they are not afraid of water and often hunt in aquatic environments.</p>
    <p>3. A tiger's roar can be heard up to 2 miles away! Their powerful roars help them communicate with other tigers and establish territory. A tigerâ€™s roar is so loud and deep that it can vibrate the ground beneath them.</p>
